- The extension only requests permissions necessary for its core functionality

## Technical Details

This extension uses:

- Browser Extension API with Manifest V3
- TypeScript for type safety and better code organization
- Modern CSS for responsive UI design

## Troubleshooting

### Keyboard shortcut doesn't work
- Ensure the shortcut isn't already assigned to another extension or browser function
- Try setting a different shortcut through the browser's extension shortcuts page

### No text detected in the image
- Make sure the selected area contains clear, readable text
- Increase the selection size to include complete text blocks
- Avoid selecting areas with complex backgrounds or low contrast

### Translation doesn't appear
- Check your internet connection, as translation requires API access
- Verify that you've given the extension necessary permissions
- Try refreshing the page and attempting the translation again
